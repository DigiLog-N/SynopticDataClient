notes

client.py:	client.py is pretty straightforward, and worked during testing. John will be using this to push data into CloudTurbine. No further testing should be needed, unless John encounters an issue.
server.py:	server.py is just a dummy receiver for client.py, in lieu of sending to an actual CloudTurbine. There is nothing additional to test.
main.py:	main.py has been tested against 14 stations and can download a year's worth of data in a reasonable amount of time.
		SynopticData stations update about once every five minutes at the quickest, based on experience. Certain sensors on certain stations could be once per hour, for instance.
			Depending on deployment, main.py could be run as a cron job, or wrapped in a loop that sleeps every n minutes.
			One test that may prove useful is wrapping and sleeping for 24-48 hours to certify is is reliable over a relatively extended period of time.
			Another test will be balancing the number of queries against the query limit, and the needs of the model.
				The paid tier has a high query limit, but the number of queries we make increases linearly with the number of stations we want.
				Once or twice an hour might be sufficient for our needs. Adjusting those parameters is a test of sorts.
